<h1> CSC2E01 - Artificial Intelligence </h1> 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most promising branch of computer science, creating smarter and intelligent machines/algorithms capable of performing tasks and making decisions that typically require human intelligence. In this course, students will learn the basics of <b>AI and its Applications</b>, different kinds of <b>Intelligent/Huristic Search Strategies</b>, <b>Knowledge Representations</b>, and the fundamentals of various <b>Machine Learning</b> algorithms. The students will also get hands-on experience working with various AI algorithms and the art of AI enabled algorithmic decision making.
